# ImageCaptioner-and-Audio-generator
## Description  
ImageCaptioner-and-Audio-Generator is a powerful tool that automatically generates descriptive captions for images and converts them into audio. This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing to provide a seamless way to bridge visual content with auditory explanations, enhancing accessibility and usability.  

## Features  
- Automatically generate descriptive captions for images.  
- Convert captions to natural-sounding audio using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.  
- Support for multiple image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).  
- Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and downloading generated audio.  
- Enhances accessibility for visually impaired users.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For image captioning model.  
- **NLP Models**: For fine-tuned text generation.  
- **gTTS/pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech conversion.
